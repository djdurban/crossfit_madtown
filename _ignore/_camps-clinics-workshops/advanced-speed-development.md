Speed is one of the most valuable traits that an athlete can obtain. This class is taught by former division one track & field athlete/elite runner, Keysha Benzing. Her Speed Development training done in a unique way following the philosophy of Run Smarter, Not Harder. Athletes are made faster and more efficient by being taught proper running mechanics, the different phases in running/sprinting (i.e.: acceleration, drive phase, max speed), proper force application/production, start technique, running posture and what it means to compete. This undulating program uses various state of the art training techniques and tools. Training can be joined at any time allowed by the extensive progressions and is open to all athletes ages 13 and up of all ability levels from novice to elite. Benzing also has the belief that yet there are those who are natural runners, it is a skill and EVERYONE can be taught to be a more efficient, effective, faster, more explosive sprinter/runner.
