### Youth Camps

**Youth Development (Ages 8-12)**

This program is designed to help the young budding athlete to learn the athletic skills necessary to be successful at any sport. The base foundation is the most important aspect to an athlete\'s future success. This class will help your child to learn how to properly jump, run, tumble, jump rope, agility, speed development and how to properly handle their own body weight though bodyweight strength training exercises. Will improve overall athleticism.

**Advanced Youth Development (Ages 10-12)****

This training program was created for our advanced/elite youth athletes. We cover the same skills, follow the same philosophy as the youth development, but done at a faster pace and with more complex skills. Perfect for "tweens". Entry into this class by permission only.

### High School Camps
 
**Intro to Strength and Power Training**

We have all of our athletes start here regardless of their lifting background/experience. We often find that our style of training is a whole new beast for most athletes. We take our training programs that are normally offered to collegiate/ professional athletes, and offer them to our local youth athletes in a fun, safe, professional and supervised environment. We develop athletes by improving their: speed, power, strength, stamina, coordination, flexibility, core, quickness, agility, mental toughness and nutrition. We then enhance the athlete into a champion through work ethic, encouraging a champion's attitude as well as teaching athletes what it means to compete. Athletes will learn properly lifting technique, mechanics, breathing and body posture.

**Advanced Strength and Power Training****

This is the training program/group we want all of our athletes striving to reach. This training group is compiled of our top-tier, local, elite athletes that are college bound, preferably on scholarship. We train these athletes just like we train our collegiate & professional athletes. They WILL be one step ahead of their teammates/competition when they reach their destination. Many of our former athletes who are now college-athletes train in this training group as well!
