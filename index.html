		<h4 class="editable">Chris Cayne</h4>
		<p class="editable">"This box is everything CrossFit is supposed to be: high quality and expert coaching on technique coupled with the constantly varied workouts. Because of work travel, I have been to a lot of CrossFit boxes and Skip and Keysha are the absolute best. I have set more PRs in the 5 months I have been going here then I had in my previous year of CrossFitting. The huge difference is not only the quality of the coaching but the quantity - this is NOT a box where they leave you to your own as you work through a WOD or towards a PR. Nothing escapes Skip and Keysha and they are quick to correct, adjust and motivate. The fact that this box exists in a "smaller" market like Madison is like winning the power ball lottery because the coaching and workouts are "big" city, professional caliber. I love this box."

		<p class="editable">"I cannot give enough praise to this box and the amazing coaches who have put me through my paces. Just over 7 months here and I have gone from fat and sedentary to winning the Madison Open Water Swim 1.2 mile wetsuit race today. 50 pounds down, feel better than I have since college and am primed to continue pushing. Thank you so much for helping bring back my competitive spirit and giving me goals to shoot for!" </p>
