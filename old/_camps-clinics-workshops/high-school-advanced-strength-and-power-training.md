This is the training program/group we want all of our athletes striving to reach. This training group is compiled of our top-tier, local, elite athletes that are college bound, preferably on scholarship. We train these athletes just like we train our collegiate & professional athletes. They WILL be one step ahead of their teammates/competition when they reach their destination. Many of our former athletes who are now college-athletes train in this training group as well!
