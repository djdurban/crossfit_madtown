### High School Introduction to Strength & Power Training

Since we often find that our style of training is a whole new beast for most athletes, all MadTown youth athletes ages 13-18 start in this program regardless of their lifting background/experience. Given our coaches\' background in training collegiate and professional athletes, we\'ve created similar programs for youth offered in a fun, safe, professional and supervised environment. We help develop young athletes by improving their speed, power, strength, stamina, coordination, flexibility, core, quickness, agility, mental toughness and nutrition. We then enhance the athlete into a champion by emphasizing work ethic, encouraging a champion\'s attitude and teaching athletes what it means to compete. Athletes will learn proper lifting technique, mechanics, breathing and body posture.

Note: Strength & Power Training must be attended at least twice a week and on same days/times consistently to ensure neuromuscular facilitation, reduce rate of injury, and develop memory retention.

### Speed Development

Speed is one of the most valuable traits that an athlete can obtain. This class is taught by Coach Keysha Benzing, former Division I track and field athlete and elite runner. Her Speed Development training is done in a unique way, following the philosophy of \"Run Smarter, Not Harder.\" Athletes are made faster and more efficient by being taught proper running mechanics, the different phases in running/sprinting (e.g., acceleration, drive phase, max speed), proper force application/production, start technique, running posture and what it means to compete. This undulating program uses various state of the art training techniques and tools. Training can be joined at any time allowed by the extensive progressions and is open to all athletes ages 13 and up, of all ability levels from novice to elite. Coach Benzing also believes that while there are \"natural runners,\" running is a skill that EVERYONE can be taught. Her program can help anyone become a more efficient, effective, faster, and more explosive sprinter/runner.

P.A.C.C.T (Plyometrics, Agility, Core, Conditioning Training)

Athletes will get in great shape with this conditioning class for levels. Great for multi-directional sport athletes. This fun class is a mix of training styles that never gets boring. Athletes are coached through various skills of jump training, multi-directional speed, agilities, various core exercises, and much more.
